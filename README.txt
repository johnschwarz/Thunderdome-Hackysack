When I used to work at Naked Sky we would play hackysack during our breaks. It was fun, and I wanted to see if I could program a hackysack game. I spent about one complete month working on this prototype.  But I wasn't completely efficient... there are unnecessary features, like the background characters buying soda from the vending machine, and occasionally spawning from the door on the spaceship, but I gained a lot of programming confidence and a greater understanding of Unity in general.  

You should be able to open the project and press play, then choose if you want to see the AI hackysack, or try it yourself.  There is a little tutorial explaining the controls.  If you want there are hidden controls not explained in the tutorial.  QW change the gravity Shift+Down Arrow clears all hackysacks, and T resets the AI.
